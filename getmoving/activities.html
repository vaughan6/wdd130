                <h2>Exercise should be fun!</h2>
                <h3>AT LEAST sometimes. And when it isn't fun, it should still be fulfilling in some other way. In light of that, I suggest that everyone should have at least one hobby that requires vigorous physical activity. On the less frequent occassion when you get to participate in this hobby, it will be so fulfilling to reap the benefits from regular exercise. Not to mention, there is often some social aspect to your hobby, which adds another layer of fun and fulfillment. Here are some of the things I have enjoyed doing. </h3>

                    <h2>Running</h2>
                    <h3>I hated running... all the time I hated running. In PE, during soccer, basketball, and football practice, and during track (I was mostly a thrower). Something hit me though after graduating high school. Did I miss it?! To this day I'm not sure what brought on the transformation. Maybe it was that I started doing it for myself, and didn't have someone timing me and judging me (or at least that is how it felt). Now though, it is my great escape. My portal to a world where nothing matters except the sensations in my body (not all good, but that's ok) and the music in my ears. Yes, I run with music and I love it, and I know that is practically against some people's religion, lol.</h3>

                    <h2>Hiking</h2>
                    <h3>I can't remember my first hike, but my first big one was when I was 12 years old. My dad and some of my uncles took me with them up Mt. Elbert, the second highest peak in the lower 48 United States of America. It was a fun journey. I loved spending time with my dad and uncles, it made me feel like a big kid, all grown up, lol. Then, there was the view from the top. It was absolutely stunned! I felt like I could see forever, and we were higher than everything. Since that time, I've been captivated by the urge to find trails and destinations that offer unique experiences. It has easily been one of my favorite pass times. Unfortunately, I've never been able to do this on a regular enough basis for it to be my primary means of exercise. It is usually just several times a year that I'm able to venture out into the wilderness, but it has been well worth it every time.</h3>

                    <h2>Climbing</h2>
                    <h3>I was first introduced to rock climbing about 7 years ago, while dating the woman that is now my wife! I really liked it the first time, but having never done it before, I was exhausted quickly. Even when I was fresh, I wasn't able to make it to the top of the 50 ft wall. I didn't start climbing regularly until about 4 years later. The first sessions were SHORT, but I built up stamina pretty quickly, and grew to love it even more quickly.</h3>

                    <h2>Hockey</h2>
                    <h3>My friend introduced me to hockey about 2 years ago. I ended up loving it just a little less than him. But it is still a blast. I'm not very good... like... at all, but it is fun, and great exercise. Plus, at 6'4" and 230 lbs., I bring a pretty good initial intemidation factor. It fades quickly though, once my oponents realize I handle the puck about as well as a one year old handles a spoon while feeding themselves. Ooof... In any case, even just ice skating is a blast. It also helps that it is much more affordable and available than hockey.</h3>

                    <h2>Playground Games</h2>
                    <h3>I feel like this hardly needs a description. I suspect most of us grew up climbing bars, going down slides, jump off of and onto playground equipment (sometimes at greater risk than our parents would have appreciated). Now that I have a three year old son, we spend most of our time just chasing each other or going down the slide as many times as humanly possible before having to leave. However, being the second child of seven has givin me the chance to participate in playgroudn games well into my adulthood. Games like tag, hide and seek, sardines, kick the can, lava monster/groundies, and more are a must any time we are together again.</h3>
