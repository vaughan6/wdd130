        One of the most common goals, especially around new years, is to loose weight, or get in better shape, or even to simply just do more physically. I hope you are inspired during your visit here to get moving! There are a large variety of benefits that come with many different types of activities, and there are some benefits that are shared by almost all forms of exercise. Here I hope to accomplish two major objectives; to give examples of hobbies I have enjoyed which gave me purpose in exercising, and to share the benefits I have personally enjoyed during times of improved fitness. Everyone enjoys different things, and has different means, but I want to share a few things that have worked for me.

      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Exercise should be fun! AT LEAST sometimes. And when it isn't fun, it should still be fulfilling in some other way. In light of that, I suggest that everyone should have at least one hobby that requires vigorous physical activity. On the less frequent occassion when you get to participate in this hobby, it will be so fulfilling to reap the benefits from regular exercise. Not to mention, there is often some social aspect to your hobby, which adds another layer of fun and fulfillment. Here are some of the things I have enjoyed doing.

      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the perks of regular exercise are obvious, and some are more subtle. Being able to do more with less effort, boosted self-esteem, and a generally longer life are probably a given. But I want to get into some ways that my life has been improved that likely don't come immediately to mind. In my family (growing up and as a father) hiking has been a sort of staple for bonding activities. It takes planning and time to get out and do, but it isn't nearly as enjoyable if you aren't physically prepared. But if you are prepared, it is a chance to break away from the numerous demands on your attention which compete for your time on a daily basis. It is a special day when you can break away from all the routine obligations and concerns to just be in the outdoors with the ones you love. The shared reward at the end of a hike, which is most often a spectacular view of awe inspiring scenery, brings you together. The drive and the hike itself is a chance to take time and talk about your lives in a way that you don't usually get the chance to. These kinds of days are some of my most fond memories. Another more subtle benefit is being capable of participating in the moment. I love a good movie, and sometimes to simply be physically together is enough to share an experience and bond. However, DOING something together is often more meaningful, more impactful, and more memorable. Whether it is climbing on playground equipment, chasing eachother around, or even just walking together, if you are physically doing something together, it is likely to mean more. Always be ready to move! And finally, a big one for me, playing hard leads to sleeping hard, sleeping hard leads to being well rested, and being well rested will always make you feel better. Not to mention if the kids take a nap, a little peace and quiet is always welcome.
