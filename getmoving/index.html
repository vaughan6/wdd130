                <h2>More than a resolution</h2>
                <h3>One of the most common goals, especially around new years, is to loose weight, or get in better shape, or even to simply just do more physically. I hope you are inspired during your visit here to get moving! There are a large variety of benefits that come with many different types of activities, and there are some benefits that are shared by almost all forms of exercise. Here I hope to accomplish two major objectives; to give examples of hobbies I have enjoyed which gave me purpose in exercising, and to share the benefits I have personally enjoyed during times of improved fitness. Everyone enjoys different things, and has different means, but I want to share a few things that have worked for me.</h3>

                    <h2>Climbing</h2>
                    <h3>Here is a photo of me introducing my friend, Alex, to climbing. He ended up loving it just a little less than me. I was first introduced to rock climbing about 7 years ago, while dating the woman that is now my wife! I really liked it the first time, but having never done it before, I was exhausted quickly. Even when I was fresh, I wasn't able to make it to the top of the 50 ft wall. I didn't start climbing regularly until about 4 years later. The first sessions were SHORT, but I built up stamina pretty quickly, and grew to love it even more quickly.</h3>

                    <h2>Hockey</h2>
                    <h3>My friend introduced me to hockey about 2 years ago. I ended up loving it just a little less than him. But it is still a blast. I'm not very good... like... at all, but it is fun, and great exercise. Plus, at 6'4" and 230 lbs., I bring a pretty good initial intemidation factor. It fades quickly though, once my oponents realize I handle the puck about as well as a one year old handles a spoon while feeding themselves. Ooof... In any case, even just ice skating is a blast. It also helps that it is much more affordable and available than hockey.</h3>

                    <h2>Running</h2>
                    <h3>I hated running... all the time I hated running. In PE, during soccer, basketball, and football practice, and during track (I was mostly a thrower). Something hit me though after graduating high school. Did I miss it?! To this day I'm not sure what brought on the transformation. Maybe it was that I started doing it for myself, and didn't have someone timing me and judging me (or at least that is how it felt). Now though, it is my great escape. My portal to a world where nothing matters except the sensations in my body (not all good, but that's ok) and the music in my ears. Yes, I run with music and I love it, and I know that is practically against some people's religion, lol.</h3>
