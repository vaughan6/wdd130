        <h2>James Vaughan</h2>

        <p>My name is James, I'm a husband and a father of two. While that short sentences describes some of the most important aspects of my life, I also like to think of myself as an adventurer, a sportsman, a gamer, an aspiring saint. Home will almost always be Colorado for me, but the US Navy currently has me living in Maryland.</p>
        <p>I was sealed to my parents at a young age, and baptized as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the ripe-old age of 8. I got to serve a full-time mission in Veracruz, Mexico. I absolutely loved the time I spent there.</p>
        <p>I work as a Network Forensic Analyst and I'm seeking a degree to increase future career opportunities.</p>
